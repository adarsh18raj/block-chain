### What is Blockchain?
- Blockchain is a system in which a record of any transaction is stored across various nodes/peers in the form of ledgers.
- All the transactions which happen on the network is added to every peer's individual ledger.
- The implications of Blockchain goes far and wide in the field of security.
- Hyperledger is an open source project initiated by Linux Foundation which provides us a platform to build such a network.
### What is this project about?
The aim of this project is to gain an deeper understanding about Blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric by the end of summer. We will do so by building a small network which enables you to do Know Your Customer(KYC) online.  
KYC involves a business to verify sensitive details of its prospective customer. This process is almost always done offline, person to person to ensure absolute security. We can ensure unshakeable security using blockchain. Built on the hyperledger fabric framework, this applicaton ensures the permissions for access granted only to the intended banks. 
### What is my role as a contributor?
- Understand how to write a chaincode in golang. You can always ask doubts on the gitter channel and we will try to help you out with it(if we know the answer xP).
- Update the basic chaincode skeleton with important functionalities.
### How do I get started?	
Please [install](https://github.com/oss2019/block-chain/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md) all prerequisites on the platform(s) on which youâ€™ll be developing blockchain applications and/or operating Hyperledger Fabric.
All the interested students can can ping us at [Community room](https://gitter.im/oss2019/community) or [Blockchain Room](https://gitter.im/oss2019/block-chain) at gitter
### What is the role of the maintainers?
- Provide answers to the queries asked.
- Help all the members to gain a deeper understanding.
- Check the authenticity and functionality of all the PRs.
### How to contribute?
- Open an issue regarding the new functionality to be added or assign yourself an unassigned problem.
- Any known issues like bugs in the code will be issued to one contributor and on failing to solve it within a week will be issued to other interested contributors.
- After solving the problem or adding the functionality open a PR which on verification by the maintainers will be merged to the repo.
